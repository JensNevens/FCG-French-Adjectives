# FCG: Position of Adjectives in French

This project is part of the course Artificial Intelligence Programming Paradigms taught at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Requires FCG Light, part of the Babel2 Framework, available at http://emergent-languages.org/Babel2/

Implements a small grammar fragment in FCG using the words _un, une, des, le, la, les, voiture, pantalon, petit, vert_. The goal is:

1. Place the adjective in the correct position, i.e. before or after the noun
2. Make the agreement between article, noun and adjective
