# FCG: Position of Adjectives in French

This project is part of the course Artificial Intelligence Programming Paradigms taught at Vrije Universiteit Brussel. Requires FCG Light, part of the Babel2 Framework, available [here](http://emergent-languages.org/Babel2/)

Implements a small grammar fragment in FCG using the words _un, une, des, le, la, les, voiture, pantalon, petit, vert_. The goal is:

1. Place the adjective in the correct position, i.e. before or after the noun
2. Make the agreement between article, noun and adjective

## How to run:

- Install the Babel2 Framework
- Run `french.lisp` or `french-adjectives.lisp`
- Go in your browser to http://localhost:8000
